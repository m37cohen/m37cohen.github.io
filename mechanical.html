        <p>In order to design a net-zero energy building that does not consume fossil fuels, the building should ideally include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A highly insulated, air tight, thermal envelope with a passive solar design</li>
            <li>Efficient mechanical equipment and appliances with smart control</li>
            <li>Local electricity production</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While #2 is the primary task for the mechanical design, it is necessary to understand the system’s interaction with all aspects of the building. With high efficiency, net-zero energy buildings, an integrated and holistic design process is critical for achieving a high level of performance. The interactions between building geometry, orientation, solar electric and thermal energy generation, passive solar heat gains, building envelope performance, structure, lighting, daylighting, shading, ventilation, hot water production, active space heating and cooling, appliance consumption and internal gains, occupant behavior, etc. are very complex and our understanding of them is essential.</p>
        <p>The services provided by the mechanical system include heating, ventilation, cooling, hot water production, as well as plumbing. Much of the mechanical system can also be considered as a thermal system. In order to design a thermal system that can appropriately collect, store, and distribute heat where and when it is required, an understanding of the overall thermal performance of the building is necessary. To accomplish this, a computer model of the building is created that includes every aspect of the building including materials, geometry, equipment and appliances, occupant schedules and behavior, etc., and the building performance is then simulated within a particular climate, based on the laws of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism. Below is a rendering of the building separated by thermal zones.</p>
        <img src="" class="concept-picture">
        <h4>Heating, Hot Water, & Cooling</h4>
        <p>A significant portion of a building’s energy consumption in Canada’s cold climate is due to space heating and hot water production. Traditional heating options each have their own disadvantages and include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wood stove – dirty and impractical for urban environments</li>
            <li>Natural Gas boiler/furnace – a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gas</li>
            <li>Electric resistive – expensive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So how do we provide heat conveniently without polluting the air or emitting greenhouse gases, at an affordable price?</p>
        <p>With a heat pump, of course! Heat pumps run on electricity, but unlike electric resistive heating which simply converts electricity to heat, heat pumps acquire the heat for free from the ground or outdoor air, and use the electricity to concentrate and augment that heat to a higher temperature by means of a refrigeration cycle. This allows the heat pump’s efficiency in converting electrical energy into useful thermal energy to reach values of 300% or greater, or a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3+. And if that’s not convincing enough, it can be reversed in the summer to act as an air-conditioner.</p>
        <p>How can we improve a heat pump’s efficiency?</p>
        <p>The greater the temperature jump that the heat pump must accomplish, the less efficient it becomes. For example if the pump must supply air at a temperature of 40 °C for space heating, but the temperature outdoors is –25 °C, the pump will have a low COP for that given day, perhaps less than 2.0. In order to improve the heat pump efficiency, we are developing a way to “trick” the heat pump into operating as if the outdoor temperature were much warmer. More precisely, we will collect solar thermal energy by preheating air in channels inside the roof, and duct that air into the heat pump.</p>
        <p>With every efficiency improvement here, or capital cost reduction there, we are contributing to the effort to reduce the cost of net-zero energy buildings, making them affordable and catalyzing their mass-market adoption. Specifically, efficiency improvements for an off-grid building reduce cost by requiring fewer solar PV panels, and in a grid-tied building by generating additional income from exported electricity (net-positive energy).</p>
        <h4>Solar Energy Collection</h4>
        <p>Our building will harvest solar energy locally in 3 distinct ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Electricity from photovoltaic cells</li>
            <li>Solar heated air (active thermal)</li>
            <li>Passive solar gains through windows (passive thermal)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To accomplish the first two, we are designing a solar roof, called a building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) roof. In addition to generating both electricity and preheated air, this roof will have a number of benefits, including:</p>
