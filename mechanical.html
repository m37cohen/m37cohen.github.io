        <h3>Thermal System Design</h3>
        <p>The services provided by the mechanical system include heating, ventilation, cooling, hot water production, as well as plumbing. Much of the mechanical system can also be considered as a thermal system. In order to design a thermal system that can appropriately collect, store, and distribute heat where and when it is required, an understanding of the overall thermal performance of the building is necessary. To accomplish this, a computer model of the building is created that includes every aspect of the building including materials, geometry, equipment and appliances, occupant schedules and behavior, etc., and the building performance is then simulated within a particular climate, based on the laws of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism. Below is a rendering of the building separated by thermal zones.</p>
        <img src="img/concept/mechanical/picture1.jpg" class="concept-picture shrink">
        <h3>Heating, Hot Water, & Cooling</h3>
        <p>Heat pumps run on electricity, but unlike electric resistive heating which simply converts electricity to heat, heat pumps acquire the heat for free from the ground or outdoor air, and use the electricity to concentrate and augment that heat to a higher temperature by means of a refrigeration cycle. This allows the heat pump’s efficiency in converting electrical energy into useful thermal energy to reach values of 300% or greater, or a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3+. And if that’s not convincing enough, it can be reversed in the summer to act as an air-conditioner.</p>
        <h4>How can we improve a heat pump’s efficiency?</h4>
        <p>In order to improve heat pump efficiency, we are developing a way to “trick” the heat pump into operating as if the outdoor temperature were much warmer. More precisely, we will collect solar thermal energy by preheating air in channels inside the roof, and duct that air into the heat pump. With every efficiency improvement, or capital cost reduction, we are contributing to the effort to reduce the cost of net-zero energy buildings, making them affordable and catalyzing their mass-market adoption. Specifically, efficiency improvements for an off-grid building reduce cost by requiring fewer solar PV panels, and in a grid-tied building by generating additional income from exported electricity (net-positive energy).</p>
        <h3>Solar Energy Collection</h3>
        <p>Our building will harvest solar energy locally in 3 distinct ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Electricity from photovoltaic cells</li>
            <li>Solar heated air (active thermal)</li>
            <li>Passive solar gains through windows (passive thermal)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To accomplish the first two items, we are designing a solar roof, called a building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) roof. In addition to generating both electricity and preheated air, this roof will have a number of benefits, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Year-round cooling of the PV cells, which improves their efficiency.</li>
            <li>With the entire southern face of the roof composed of PV panels, it will be more aesthetically pleasing than an add-on roof mounted system.</li>
            <li>By eliminating the need for some roofing materials as compared to an add-on roof mounted system, a building-integrated system has the potential to reduce the cost of the overall roof + solar array.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="img/concept/mechanical/picture3.png" class="concept-picture side-by-side">
        <h3>Custom Heat Pump</h3>
        <p>In addition to generating solar preheated air to improve the efficiency of the heat pump, we have tasked ourselves with reducing energy consumption of the thermal system as a whole without significantly increasing complexity.</p>
        <p>To achieve this goal, the following strategies have been implemented:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Centralization - The main heat pump has been combined with the hot water heat pump into a single centralized unit, improving efficiency and reducing complexity.</li>
            <li>Flexibility – The heat pump is connected to a variety of heat sinks and sources and is able to intelligently switch between them depending on climatic conditions, solar irradiance, occupant demand, and time-of-use electricity prices. This ensures that at any given time, energy is being moved to and from the most appropriate places to minimize energy consumption and maximize solar energy collection, while satisfying occupant needs (see figure and table below).</li>
            <li>Thermal Energy Storage – By having the ability to store heat (in a tank, thermal mass, and phase change materials), excess solar energy can be harvested during the day and saved for space heating at night, maximizing the benefits of the solar roof, or the tank can be charged at night when electricity is cheap, depending on whether the building is in an off-grid or grid-tied scenario, and whether the jurisdiction uses time-of-use pricing. In an off-grid scenario thermal energy storage can significantly offset the need for battery storage, reducing capital cost.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/concept/mechanical/picture4.png" class="concept-picture shrink">
        <h3>Heat Recovery</h3>
        <p>The flexibility of the heat pump also allows for energy recovery during the production of hot water:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summer – In cooling mode the heat pump will transfer heat from the interior space to the domestic hot water tank, thereby serving two purposes simultaneously and eliminating the necessity of liquid solar thermal collectors, simplifying design and reducing capital cost.</li>
            <li>Winter – During cold but sunny winter days, highly insulated passive solar buildings can overheat. Having the ability to extract that heat to produce domestic hot water or for thermal storage allows not only for heat recovery, but for the maximization of free passive gains in winter with increased South window area. This is a novel example of passive – active design interaction and a fully integrative design.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Aside from the heat pump, heat contained in warm wastewater will be recovered by incoming cold city/well water using a drain water heat recovery unit. This will reduce the domestic hot water heating load on the heat pump year-round.</p>
        <h3>Ventilation</h3>
        <p>A CO2 sensing standalone ventilation system ensures fresh air is only provided when it is needed throughout the building in a well-balanced distribution system. This means that when no one is home, no energy will be wasted on unnecessary ventilation, yet when twenty people are present during a party, fresh air supply will abundant. The energy recovery ventilator (ERV) unit is 92% efficient at recovering energy (sensible and latent heat) and has an ECM motor that consumes only 20-30 watts. It includes a bypass with economizer control that provides “free cooling” when possible, eliminating the need to operate the air conditioning, or to always rely on attentive operation of operable windows by occupants.</p>
