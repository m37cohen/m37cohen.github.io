        <h3>Acoustics Design</h3>
        <p>The quality of a building is often evaluated according to its energy efficiency, which can overshadow other aspects that influence indoor comfort, such as acoustic performance. The standards that are enforced today do not meet all requirements necessary to achieve healthy acoustical levels. It is known that unhealthy environments can reduce productivity and communication while increasing stress levels of occupants. For this reason, a holistic acoustical design approach should be considered to ensure superior living comfort.</p>
        <p>A comfortable acoustic design can be achieved primarily by reducing sound transmission between different environments. Unwanted sound from the exterior and adjacent spaces can create distracting and otherwise uncomfortable building situations. Material selection and reduced 'acoustical bridging' through innovative solutions will help in achieve an optimal occupant experience.</p>
        <h3>Building Envelope</h3>
        <h4>Why?</h4>
        <p>The building envelope is one of the most important features of an energy efficient and comfortable home. It is the skin of the building which controls the passage of heat, air, moisture, and sound from the interior to the great outdoors.In a cold climate such as Toronto's, it is especially important that these control layers be effective. In typical Canadian residential homes, space heating accounts for 63% of the annual energy consumption (Natural Resources Canada, 2013). With more efficient building envelopes, this number can be greatly decreased.</p>
        <h4>Our Vision</h4>
        <p>We are designing a house which is not only extremely energy efficient, but also comfortable. This means being able to get out of the shower in the winter and have the bathroom still be warm, and not have rivers of water running down the walls and windows due to cold surface temperatures. To be able to sit by the window and not feel the cold radiating from it. To not have cold, unwanted drafts drifting through the house. In the summer, not having an imbalanced cool body temperature from the air conditioning system while the sun streams in the window. The ECOstudio home will be comfortable at all times of year, no matter where you are in the house.</p>
        <h4>How?</h4>
        <p>There are many components to high performing building envelope which need to work together as a coherent system. In order for the wall to keep the inside environment inside, and the outside environment outside, five general control layers are required. These are thermal, air, moisture, sound, and bulk water.</p>
        <p>Before choosing a wall system type, we looked at different types of wall systems, which were generally divided into two: framed construction and panel systems (see Figure 1). From these, we looked into three wall systems according to best performance: TJI walls, which are walls using I-joists instead of studs, Double Stud walls, and SIP walls.</p>
        <h3>Indoor Air Quality</h3>
        <h4>Why?</h4>
        <p>For the Canadian population, the average life expectancy is 81 years (Richard Corsi, 2014). Roughly 72 years out of those are spent indoors. That means that the average Canadian spends 90% of their time indoors. It has been known that many pollutants increase risks for diseases and even reduce living years (see Figure 1). In one study, it was shown that increasing PM10 by 10 μg/m3 increased death by 0.51% (Samet et al., 2000). And yet, it isn’t common practice to consider indoor air quality when a home is built. Indoor air quality testing is expensive and so it is important to try to get air quality right from the start. Indoor air quality is one of the many important aspects to create a healthy home and that starts by creating designs that mitigate harmful pollutants.<p>
        <h4>Our Vision</h4>
        <p>We are looking to design a house that apart from performing well, it also provides a safe, healthy space for its occupants. To provide this, we will be looking at indoor air quality and different methods of mitigation whether it is source control, ventilation, or air cleaning. We are looking to at least meet Health Canada’s recommended concentration guidelines. The main pollutants we will be looking to mitigate are harmful VOCs and formaldehyde that are likely to be emitted due new construction materials, ozone, which is likely to be higher in Toronto, and PM2.5. While not all pollutants are equally important, we will be paying close attention to those three pollutants to provide a healthier home for the occupants.</p>
        <h4>How?</h4>
        <p>Due to our house being newly constructed, we are going to be looking at mitigation measures that include passive air cleaning by using materials that promote deposition, active air filtering via our ventilation system, source control especially when it comes to material selection, and fresh air ventilation.</p>
        <p>Since we are still in a very preliminary phase regarding the house design, our house’s air quality conditions are yet to be defined. As more conditions are defined, different models can be used to determine air quality at any given time. One of the methods is to create a mass balance to determine the house’s pollutant concentration at equilibrium. This can be derived from the equation shown below:</p>
